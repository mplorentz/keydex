## 🚀 How to Proceed

### Option 1: Start Background Agent in Cursor

1. Open Cursor Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Search for "Cursor: Start Agent" or similar
3. Paste this prompt:

```
Please complete the Riverpod migration task specified in BACKGROUND_AGENT_TASK.md.

Start by reading:
1. BACKGROUND_AGENT_TASK.md - Your main instructions
2. lib/screens/lockbox_list_screen.dart - Reference implementation
3. .cursor/migration_checklist.md - Track your progress

Begin with edit_lockbox_screen.dart and work through all 9 screens in order.
Commit after each successful migration.

Follow the patterns exactly as shown in lockbox_list_screen.dart.
```

### Option 2: Manual Agent Prompt

If Cursor's background agent UI is different, use this as a chat prompt:

```
I need you to complete a large refactoring task. Read BACKGROUND_AGENT_TASK.md for full instructions.

Summary: Migrate 9 Flutter screens from StatefulWidget to Riverpod ConsumerWidget pattern.

Reference: lib/screens/lockbox_list_screen.dart (already migrated successfully)

Start with: lib/screens/edit_lockbox_screen.dart

Work methodically through all screens, creating providers as needed, testing each one, and committing atomically.
```

### Option 3: Manual Migration

Follow these steps yourself:
1. Read `BACKGROUND_AGENT_TASK.md`
2. Start with `edit_lockbox_screen.dart`
3. Follow the pattern from `lockbox_list_screen.dart`
4. Check off items in `.cursor/migration_checklist.md`
5. Commit after each screen

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The migration is complete when:
- [ ] All 9 screens migrated to ConsumerWidget
- [ ] All 3 new providers created
- [ ] `flutter analyze` passes
- [ ] `flutter test` passes
- [ ] App runs without errors
- [ ] All user flows tested
- [ ] Checklist 100% complete

## 📊 Expected Time

- Simple screens (2): ~30-45 min each
- Medium screens (4): ~1-2 hours each
- Complex screens (3): ~2-3 hours each
- **Total estimated:** 8-12 hours for complete migration

## 🔑 Key Success Factors

1. **Follow the pattern** - lockbox_list_screen.dart is your blueprint
2. **Test incrementally** - Hot reload after each change
3. **Commit atomically** - One screen per commit
4. **Use AsyncValue.when()** - Don't manually manage loading states
5. **Extract widgets** - Keep files readable
6. **Ask for help** - If a pattern doesn't fit, ask the user
