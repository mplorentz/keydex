# Keydex - Secure Text Lockboxes

**The best way to backup sensitive data.**

Keydex is a Flutter mobile application that provides secure, encrypted storage for sensitive text content using NIP-44 encryption with Nostr key pairs. Store passwords, private notes, API keys, and other confidential information with military-grade encryption.

## üîê Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Uses NIP-44 encryption with Nostr key pairs
- **Biometric Authentication**: Secure access with fingerprint or face recognition
- **Local Storage Only**: All data stays on your device - no cloud dependencies
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful Material Design 3 interface with dark/light themes
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with Flutter for iOS and Android
- **Open Source**: Transparent security you can verify

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Flutter 3.5.4 or higher
- Dart 3.5.4 or higher
- Android Studio / Xcode for mobile development
- Device with biometric authentication (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/keydex.git
   cd keydex
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Generate mock files (for development)**
   ```bash
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build
   ```

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   # For development
   flutter run
   
   # For Android release
   flutter build apk --release
   
   # For iOS release (requires Xcode)
   flutter build ios --release
   ```

## üì± Usage

### First Launch Setup

1. **Launch Keydex** - You'll see the authentication screen
2. **Set Up Security** - Tap "Set Up Security" to configure biometric authentication
3. **Create Your First Lockbox** - Tap the "+" button to create an encrypted lockbox
4. **Store Sensitive Data** - Add passwords, notes, or any confidential text

### Creating a Lockbox

1. Tap the floating action button ("+") on the main screen
2. Enter a descriptive name (up to 100 characters)
3. Add your sensitive content (up to 4,000 characters)
4. Tap "Create Encrypted Lockbox"
5. Your data is encrypted using NIP-44 and stored locally

### Accessing Lockboxes

1. Authenticate using biometrics when prompted
2. Tap any lockbox card to view its encrypted content
3. Use the eye icon to show/hide content
4. Tap the copy icon to copy content to clipboard

### Managing Lockboxes

- **Edit**: Tap the edit icon to modify content or name
- **Delete**: Use the menu (‚ãÆ) to delete lockboxes permanently
- **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific lockboxes

## üîß Configuration

### Authentication Settings

Access via Settings ‚Üí Security:

- **Biometric Authentication**: Toggle biometric security on/off
- **Encryption Key**: View key status and export backups
- **Key Rotation**: Generate new encryption keys periodically

### App Settings

Access via Settings:

- **Theme**: Choose between light, dark, or system theme
- **Storage Usage**: View app data size
- **Clear All Data**: Reset the app completely

## üîí Security

### Encryption Details

- **Algorithm**: NIP-44 (Nostr Improvement Proposal 44)
- **Key Generation**: Cryptographically secure random key pairs
- **Key Storage**: Encrypted and stored in device keychain
- **Authentication**: Biometric (fingerprint/face) or device passcode

### Security Best Practices

1. **Enable Biometric Authentication**: Always use biometric locks when available
2. **Regular Backups**: Export your encryption key backup and store it securely
3. **Key Rotation**: Rotate encryption keys periodically for enhanced security
4. **Device Security**: Ensure your device has a secure lock screen
5. **App Updates**: Keep Keydex updated for latest security improvements

### Data Storage

- **Location**: All data stored locally on device using SharedPreferences
- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted before storage
- **No Cloud**: No data ever transmitted to external servers
- **Privacy**: Complete privacy - only you can access your data
