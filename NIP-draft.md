# NIP-XX: Shamir's Secret Sharing for Distributed Backup

`draft` `optional`

## Abstract

This NIP defines a protocol for backup and recovery of sensitive data with peers via the Nostr network. It uses [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing) algorithm to break secret data (a *vault*) into a number of shares which are distributed via encrypted Nostr events to a pre-defined set of trusted peers (called *stewards*). These stewards can then combine their shares in order to recover the original secret.

## Overview

The system consists of several phases:

1. **Invitation Phase** (optional): Vault owner invites key holders via unique invitation codes
2. **Distribution Phase**: Vault owner splits the secret into shares and distributes them to key holders via encrypted events
4. **Recovery Phase**: Any key holder can initiate recovery, requesting shares from other key holders. Once enough shares are assembled the key can be decrypted.

*TODO: Say something about the p2p assumptions made here. One share == one device atm*

## Event Kinds

This protocol defines the following custom event kinds:

*TODO: all event kinds subject to change*

- `1337`: Share Distribution
- `1338`: Recovery Request
- `1339`: Recovery Response  
- `1340`: Invitation Acceptance
- `1341`: Invitation Denial
- `1342`: Share Confirmation *TODO: is there some generic ACK kind already we should reuse here?*
- `1343`: Share Error
- `1344`: Invitation Invalid
- `1345`: Steward Removed

All events MUST be wrapped using NIP-59 gift wrap (kind 1059) for privacy and MAY include NIP-40 expiration tags.

## Event Flow

The event flow goes something like this:

- Owner optionally distributes invitiation codes via a link or some other method. Each steward should receive a unique code that they can include in an Invititation Acceptance (or Invitation Denial) event. This event represents consent from the steward to hold a share and serves as a convenient way for the owner to learn the steward's preferred npub.
- After all stewards have been added, the owner distributes a share to each steward in a Share Distribution event. Stewards MUST respond with a Share Confirmation event after receiving their share. The owner MAY decide to keep a share for themselves and destroy the secret.
- From here any steward or the owner can initiate recovery by sending Recovery Requests to all stewards. Stewards respond with a Recovery Response, which includes their share if they approved the request.
- At any point the owner may change the secret or other parameters and send new Share Distribution events for the same vault, incrementing the distribution_version number in the event content. *TODO: Stewards MUST destroy the old shares once everyone has confirmed that they have the new shares, but how will they know? Probably we need another event.*
- At any point a Steward may receive a Steward Removed event from the owner. If received the steward MUST destroy their share.

*TODO: How do we version this protocol to support i.e. large files in the future*

## Event Structures

### Share Distribution (Kind 1337)

Used to distribute a Shamir secret share to a steward.

**Note:** This event MUST be wrapped in a NIP-59 gift wrap (kind 1059 containing kind 13 seal) before publishing.

*TODO: **sigh** should I put the share data in the tags or stringified JSON in the contents? 🤷‍♂️*

## Threat Model

**What this protocol protects against**:
- Single point of failure (no single steward can access the secret)
- Centralized service compromise (fully decentralized)
- Relay censorship (use multiple relays)
- Steward unavailability (redundancy through n > t)

**What this protocol does NOT protect against**:
- Collusion of ≥ t stewards
- Compromise of the vault owner's device before distribution
- Social engineering attacks on stewards during recovery
- Malicious stewards providing false recovery responses
