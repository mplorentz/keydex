# Feature Specification: Encrypted Text Lockbox

**Feature Branch**: `001-store-text-in-lockbox`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "user should be able to store text in an encrypted 'lockbox'"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to securely store sensitive text information in an encrypted lockbox so that I can back up my private data recover it when needed.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user wants to store sensitive text, **When** they create a new lockbox and enter their text, **Then** the text is encrypted and stored securely
2. **Given** a user has created a lockbox with encrypted text, **When** they access the lockbox, **Then** they can view the decrypted text content
3. **Given** a user has multiple lockboxes, **When** they view their lockbox list, **Then** they can see all their lockboxes by name and select the one they want to access
4. **Given** a user wants to update their stored text, **When** they edit the lockbox content, **Then** the new text is encrypted and replaces the previous content
5. **Given** a user no longer needs a lockbox, **When** they delete it, **Then** the encrypted data is permanently removed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to create a lockbox with empty text? We allow this. Maybe they want to share it with peers before adding data to it.
- How does the system handle very large text content? For now, content is limited to 4k. Later on we will add features to increase the size.
- What happens if encryption/decryption fails during storage or retrieval? Show the user an error message explaining that something has gone wrong and they should contact support with the given error code.
- How does the system handle concurrent access to the same lockbox? Only one user should be using the app at a time, and only that user can update the lockbox.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new encrypted lockboxes for storing text content
- **FR-002**: System MUST encrypt all text content before storage using NIP-44.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to name their lockboxes for easy identification
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a secure method for users to access and decrypt their stored text
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to edit and update the text content in existing lockboxes
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to delete lockboxes and permanently remove encrypted data
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a list of all user's lockboxes with their names
- **FR-008**: System MUST require biometric authentication or password to access lockboxes
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle encryption/decryption errors gracefully and inform the user
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent unauthorized access to encrypted lockbox content

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Lockbox**: A secure container that holds encrypted text content, identified by a user-provided name and containing the encrypted data
- **Text Content**: The actual sensitive information that users want to store securely, which gets encrypted before storage
- **Encryption Key**: The Nostr key used to encrypt and decrypt the text content.
