# Data Model: Distributed Backup of Lockboxes

## Core Entities

### BackupConfig
Represents the backup configuration for a lockbox.

**Fields**:
- `lockboxId: String` - Unique identifier for the lockbox
- `specVersion: String` - Specification version for backup protocol (e.g., "1.0.0") for compatibility tracking
- `threshold: int` - Number of keys required to reconstruct the lockbox (minimum 2, maximum 10)
- `totalKeys: int` - Total number of keys created (must be >= threshold)
- `keyHolders: List<KeyHolder>` - List of trusted contacts who hold keys
- `relays: List<String>` - List of Nostr relay URLs used for communication
- `createdAt: DateTime` - When backup was configured
- `lastUpdated: DateTime` - When backup was last modified
- `lastContentChange: DateTime?` - When lockbox contents were last modified
- `lastRedistribution: DateTime?` - When shares were last redistributed
- `contentHash: String?` - Hash of current lockbox contents for change detection
- `status: BackupStatus` - Current status of the backup

**Validation Rules**:
- `specVersion` must be valid semantic version (e.g., "1.0.0", "2.1.3")
- `threshold` must be >= 2 and <= `totalKeys`
- `totalKeys` must be >= `threshold` and <= 10

- All relay URLs must be valid and accessible
- `contentHash` must be valid SHA-256 hash if present
- `lastRedistribution` must be >= `lastContentChange` if both present

**State Transitions**:
- `PENDING` → `ACTIVE` (when all keys distributed successfully and acknowledged)
- `ACTIVE` → `PENDING` (when configuration changes or content changes detected)
- `ACTIVE` → `INACTIVE` (when backup is disabled)
- `PENDING` → `FAILED` (when key distribution fails)

### KeyHolder
Represents a trusted contact who holds a backup key.

**Fields**:

- `PUBLISHED` → `CONFIRMED` (when recipient acknowledges receipt)
- `PUBLISHED` → `FAILED` (when publishing fails)

### ShardData
Represents the decrypted shard data contained within a ShardEvent.

**Fields**:
- `shard: String` - Base64-encoded Shamir shard bytes
- `threshold: int` - Number of shards required for reconstruction

- `primeMod: String` - Base64-encoded prime modulus for Shamir reconstruction
- `creatorPubkey: String` - Public key of the lockbox creator (for verification)
- `createdAt: int` - Unix timestamp when shard was created

**Validation Rules**:
- `shard` must be valid Base64-encoded bytes
- `threshold` must be >= 2 and <= `totalShards`
- `shardIndex` must be >= 0 and < `totalShards`
- `primeMod` must be valid Base64-encoded bytes

### BackupStatus (Enum)
- `PENDING` - Backup configuration created but keys not yet distributed or need redistribution
- `ACTIVE` - All keys successfully distributed and backup is functional
- `INACTIVE` - Backup is disabled or configuration is invalid
- `FAILED` - Key distribution failed and backup is not functional

### KeyHolderStatus (Enum)
- `PENDING` - Key holder added but gift wrap event not yet published
- `ACTIVE` - Gift wrap event published and key holder is responsive
- `ACKNOWLEDGED` - Key holder has acknowledged receipt of their key share

## Relationships

### BackupConfig → KeyHolder (1:N)
- One backup configuration has many key holders
- Each key holder belongs to exactly one backup configuration
- Cascade delete: removing backup config removes all key holders

### BackupConfig → ShardEvent (1:N)
- One backup configuration generates many shard events
- Each shard event belongs to exactly one backup configuration
- Cascade delete: removing backup config removes all shard events

### KeyHolder → ShardEvent (1:1)
- Each key holder has exactly one shard event
- Each shard event is for exactly one key holder
- Relationship maintained through `recipientNpub` field

### ShardEvent → ShardData (1:1)
- Each shard event contains exactly one shard data when decrypted
- Shard data is encrypted within the shard event's content

## Data Flow

### Backup Creation Flow
1. User creates `BackupConfig` with threshold, totalKeys, and relay URLs
2. System sets `specVersion` to current specification version (e.g., "1.0.0")
3. User adds `KeyHolder` entities with Nostr public keys
4. System validates configuration, key holders, and relay connectivity
5. System generates Shamir shares for the lockbox
6. System creates `GiftWrapEvent` entities for each key holder
7. System publishes gift wrap events to specified Nostr relays
8. System waits for acknowledgment events from key holders
9. System updates statuses based on publishing and acknowledgment results
10. System sets `contentHash` and `lastRedistribution` timestamps

### Recovery Flow
1. User initiates recovery process
2. System retrieves `BackupConfig` for the lockbox
3. System checks `specVersion` field for compatibility
4. System collects `GiftWrapEvent` entities from Nostr relays
5. System decrypts Shamir shares using recipient's private key
6. System reconstructs original lockbox data using Shamir's algorithm
7. System validates reconstructed data integrity

### Configuration Update Flow
1. User modifies `BackupConfig` (threshold, key holders, relays)
2. System invalidates existing `GiftWrapEvent` entities
3. System generates new Shamir shares
4. System creates new `GiftWrapEvent` entities
5. System publishes new gift wrap events to updated relay list
6. System waits for acknowledgment events from key holders
7. System updates all statuses based on results
8. System updates `lastRedistribution` timestamp

### Specification Version Migration Flow
1. System detects `BackupConfig` with older `specVersion` during recovery
2. System checks compatibility with current specification version
3. If compatible: System proceeds with recovery using current algorithms
4. If incompatible: System triggers migration process
5. System updates `specVersion` field to current specification version
6. System redistributes shares using new format
7. System updates all related entities with new specification version

### Content Change Detection Flow
1. User modifies lockbox contents
2. System calculates new `contentHash` of lockbox data
3. System compares new hash with stored `contentHash`
4. If different: System sets `lastContentChange` and changes status to `PENDING`
5. System triggers redistribution process (same as Configuration Update Flow)
6. System updates `lastRedistribution` and `contentHash` after successful redistribution

## Security Considerations

### Data Encryption
- All Shamir shares encrypted using NIP-44 before storage/transmission
- Gift wrap events provide additional encryption layer
- No plaintext sensitive data stored anywhere in the system

### Key Management
- Shamir shares generated using cryptographically secure random numbers
- Each share encrypted with recipient's public key
- Original lockbox data never stored in distributed form

### Access Control
- Only lockbox owner can modify backup configuration
- Key holders can only access their own encrypted shares
- No central authority controls backup or recovery process
