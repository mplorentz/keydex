# Tasks: Distributed Backup of Lockboxes

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-distributed-backup-of/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Dart/Flutter tech stack, ntc_dcrypto, NDK dependencies
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, UI components
   → Integration: Nostr service, backup service
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → UI stubs before implementation (Outside-In)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Manual verification of UI stubs before implementing functionality
- Refactoring passes clean up code before adding complexity
- Unit tests written after implementation and refactoring
- Integration tests written last for complete workflow validation
- Commit after each task
- Security-first approach: Shamir's Secret Sharing implementation before UI integration
- Outside-In development: UI stubs first, then implementation behind components
- Cross-platform testing on all 5 Flutter target platforms
- Nostr protocol compliance for gift wrap events (kind 1059)
- NIP-44 encryption for all sensitive data transmission

## Task Generation Rules Applied
1. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity (BackupConfig, KeyHolder, ShardEvent, ShardData) → model creation task [P]
   - Each enum (BackupStatus, KeyHolderStatus, EventStatus) → enum creation task [P]
   
2. **From Research**:
   - ntc_dcrypto library → dependency setup task
   - NDK extension → service extension task
   - NIP-44/NIP-59 → encryption implementation tasks
   
3. **From Plan**:
   - UI components → stub tasks first, then implementation
   - Services → parallel creation tasks [P]
   - Integration → test tasks after implementation
   
4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → UI Stubs → Models → Services → UI Implementation → Refactoring → Edge Cases → Tests
   - Dependencies block parallel execution where files are shared
