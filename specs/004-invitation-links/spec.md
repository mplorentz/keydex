# Feature Specification: Invitation Links for Key Holders

**Feature Branch**: `004-invitation-links`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "a new feature: invitation links. This should allow lockbox owners to invite others to be a key holder for their lockbox by sending them a link. The links should be Universal Links on ios, and the appropriate similar feature on other platforms. I have purchased the domain keydex.app for this purpose. Consumers of the link may or may not already be keydex users. In either case tapping the linnk should giuide the user to becoming a key holder for the lockbox they were invited to. The backup config screen should give the user a place to generate these invitation links and copy them. We should generate a unique link for each person invited, so before generating the link we shoul dhave the user enter a name of who they are sending the link to. I think the link will need to contain a special invite code which can then be sent back to teh lockbox owner in an encyrpted event to authenticate the key holder once they have set up an account. That event should contain the public key of the key holder. Then once the locbkox owner has received the public keys of all the invited share holders they can generate the shards and distribute them. We should still keep the functionality for them to enter npubs directly. The invite link should also contain the URL of the relays to use for communication, and the public key of the lockbox owner."

## Execution Flow (main)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a lockbox owner, I want to invite friends and family to become key holders by sending them a simple invitation link, so that I don't need to manually exchange Nostr public keys and can make the process more accessible to people who may not already be Keydex users. When someone taps the invitation link, they should be guided through the process of becoming a key holder for my lockbox, whether they already have Keydex installed or need to set it up first.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a lockbox owner is configuring backup settings, **When** they want to invite someone as a key holder, **Then** they can enter the invitee's name and generate a unique invitation link
2. **Given** a lockbox owner has generated an invitation link, **When** they share it with an invitee via any communication method (text, email, etc.), **Then** the invitee can tap the link to open Keydex
3. **Given** an invitee taps an invitation link, **When** they don't have Keydex installed, **Then** they are guided to install Keydex and set up an account
4. **Given** an invitee taps an invitation link, **When** they already have Keydex installed, **Then** they are guided to accept the invitation and become a key holder
5. **Given** an invitee accepts an invitation by completing account setup, **When** they confirm acceptance, **Then** their public key is sent to the lockbox owner via encrypted event
6. **Given** a lockbox owner has received public keys from all invited key holders, **When** they open the lockbox detail screen, **Then** they should see a button to generate and distribute keys
7. **Given** a lockbox owner has received public keys from all invited key holders, **When** they click a button to distribute keys from the lockbox detail screen, **Then** they can generate keys and distribute them to all key holders
8. **Given** a key holder opens Keydex and receives their shard, **When** they successfully process and store it, **Then** they automatically send a confirmation event back to the lockbox owner
9. **Given** a lockbox owner views their lockbox details, **When** they check the key holder list, **Then** they can see the status of each key holder (invited, awaiting key, holding key, or error)
10. **Given** a lockbox owner is configuring backup, **When** they prefer to add key holders directly, **Then** they can still enter Nostr public keys (npubs) manually as an alternative to invitation links

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an invitation link is tapped multiple times or by multiple people? Invitation links can only be redeemed once. If a second person tries to redeem it, the lockbox owner should send them an event detailing that the code was invalid. The lockbox owner should keep a table of invitation codes and mark when they have been used. The system should log an error message that the link has already been redeemed.
- How does the system handle when an invitee taps a link but decides not to accept the invitation? In that case, the system should send an event back to the lockbox owner letting them know the invitation was denied. The lockbox owner should invalidate the invitation code.
- What occurs when a lockbox owner generates an invitation link but then modifies the backup configuration before the invitee accepts? The invitation should still work given that the backup configuration still includes the invitee. But if the invitee has been removed from the backup configuration, the system should send them a Nostr event letting them know they have been removed from the lockbox.
- How does the system handle when an invitee accepts an invitation but the lockbox owner hasn't yet generated shards? The invitee will be in "awaiting key" status until shards are distributed. The lockbox detail screen should show a button to generate and distribute keys when all invited key holders have accepted.
- What happens when a key holder receives their shard but fails to process it? They should go into an error status, and the lockbox owner should see an error status. The key holder should publish an event for the lockbox owner to let them know an error has occurred.
- How does the system handle network interruptions during invitation acceptance or shard confirmation? The system should retry sending events and provide user feedback about pending operations.
- What occurs when an invitation link is shared with someone who is already a key holder for that lockbox? The system should handle it gracefully. If they redeem an invitation to a lockbox they are already a part of, the system should show a message locally that they are already a member of that lockbox.
- How does the system handle invitation links that are invalid or malformed? The app should display an error message and guide the user appropriately.

## User Interface Flow *(mandatory)*

### Backup Configuration Screen - Invitation Link Generation
The backup configuration screen should include a new section for generating invitation links:

1. **Invitation Section Header**: "Invite Key Holders" or similar
2. **Invitation Method Selection**: Toggle or buttons to choose between "Invite by Link" and "Add by Public Key"
3. **Invite by Link Flow**:
   - Input field: "Enter invitee's name" (required before generating link)

### Invitation Link Handling
When a user taps an invitation link:

1. **Link Detection**: App opens and recognizes the invitation link format
2. **Account Check**: 
   - If user has account: Navigate to invitation acceptance screen
   - If user doesn't have account: Navigate to account setup flow, then invitation acceptance
3. **Invitation Acceptance Screen**:
   - Display lockbox owner's information
   - Display invitation details
   - Button: "Accept Invitation" or "Become Key Holder"
   - Confirmation dialog explaining what being a key holder means
4. **Post-Acceptance**: 
   - Show status: "Invitation accepted. Waiting for key distribution."
   - Send RSVP event automatically

### Lockbox Detail Screen - Key Holder Status
The key holder list section should display status for each key holder:

1. **Key Holder Item Display**:
   - Name or public key identifier
   - Status indicator (badge or icon) showing: invited, awaiting key, holding key, or error
   - Status text explanation
2. **Status Definitions**:
   - **Invited**: Invitation link sent but not yet accepted
   - **Awaiting Key**: Invitation accepted, public key received, but shard not yet distributed
   - **Holding Key**: Shard distributed and confirmation received
   - **Error**: Failed to process invitation, shard distribution, or confirmation
3. **Generate and Distribute Keys Button**:
   - Displayed when all invited key holders have accepted their invitations
   - Allows lockbox owner to trigger key generation and distribution
   - Only visible to lockbox owners

## Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Invitation Link**: A unique URL containing an invite code, relay URLs, and lockbox owner's public key, used to invite someone to become a key holder
- **Invite Code**: A unique identifier embedded in an invitation link that authenticates the invitation and links it to a specific lockbox and invitee, can only be redeemed once
- **Invitation Code Table**: A data structure maintained by the lockbox owner tracking invitation codes and their redemption status (used/unused)
- **RSVP Event**: An encrypted Nostr event sent by an invitee to accept an invitation, containing their public key and the invite code
- **Invitation Denial Event**: An encrypted Nostr event sent by an invitee who declines an invitation, informing the lockbox owner and invalidating the invitation code
- **Shard Confirmation Event**: An encrypted Nostr event sent by a key holder after successfully processing and storing their shard, confirming receipt to the lockbox owner
- **Shard Error Event**: An encrypted Nostr event sent by a key holder when they fail to process their shard, informing the lockbox owner of the error
- **Invitation Status**: The current state of an invitation for a key holder (invited, awaiting key, holding key, or error)
