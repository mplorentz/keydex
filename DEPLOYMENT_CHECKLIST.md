## 🔄 Version Management Strategy

### Version Format
- Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH+BUILD_NUMBER`
- Example: `1.0.0+1`
- Defined in: `pubspec.yaml`

### Version Guidelines
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes
- **BUILD_NUMBER**: Increment for each build (required for both stores)

### Incrementing Versions
- iOS: Both version name and build number must increment
- Android: versionCode (build number) must always increase
- Update in `pubspec.yaml` before each release

---

## 🚀 CI/CD Setup (Optional but Recommended)

### GitHub Actions for Automated Builds
- [ ] Create workflow for iOS builds
  - Archive and upload to TestFlight
  - Requires Apple API key or App Store Connect API

- [ ] Create workflow for Android builds
  - Build AAB and upload to Play Console
  - Requires Google Play service account

- [ ] Set up secrets in GitHub:
  - [ ] `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`
  - [ ] `APPLE_API_ISSUER_ID`
  - [ ] `APPLE_API_KEY` (base64 encoded .p8 file)
  - [ ] `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`
  - [ ] `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`
  - [ ] `KEY_PASSWORD`
  - [ ] `KEYSTORE_BASE64` (base64 encoded keystore)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### iOS Common Issues
- **"No signing certificate found"**: Generate certificate in Xcode or Apple Developer Portal
- **"Provisioning profile doesn't match"**: Update provisioning profile or use automatic signing
- **"Invalid bundle identifier"**: Ensure bundle ID matches App Store Connect exactly

### Android Common Issues
- **"Keystore file not found"**: Check path in `key.properties`
- **"Keystore password incorrect"**: Verify passwords in `key.properties`
- **"Version code already used"**: Increment version code in `pubspec.yaml`
